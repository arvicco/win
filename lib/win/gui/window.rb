      # *Remarks*:
      # Windows 98/Me: The system restricts which processes can set the foreground window. A process can set
      # the foreground window only if one of the following conditions is true:
      # - The process is the foreground process.
      # - The process was started by the foreground process.
      # - The process received the last input event.
      # - There is no foreground process.
      # - The foreground process is being debugged.
      # - The foreground is not locked (see LockSetForegroundWindow).
      # - The foreground lock time-out has expired (see SPI_GETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT in SystemParametersInfo).
      # - Windows 2000/XP: No menus are active.
      #
      # With this change, an application cannot force a window to the foreground while the user is working
      # with another window. Instead, Foreground and Background Windows will activate the window (see
      # SetActiveWindow) and call the function to notify the user. However, on Microsoft Windows 98 and
      # Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me), if a nonforeground thread calls SetForegroundWindow and
      # passes the handle of a window that was not created by the calling thread, the window is not flashed on
      # the taskbar. To have SetForegroundWindow behave the same as it did on Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows
      # NT 4.0, change the foreground lock timeout value when the application is installed. This can be done
      # from the setup or installation application with the following function call:
      # SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT, 0, (LPVOID)0, SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE |
      # SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE);
      # This method allows SetForegroundWindow on Windows 98/Windows Me and Windows 2000/Windows XP to behave
      # the same as Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, respectively, for all applications. The setup application
      # should warn the user that this is being done so that the user isn't surprised by the changed behavior.
      # On Windows Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the call fails unless the calling thread can change the
      # foreground window, so this must be called from a setup or patch application. For more information, see
      # Foreground and Background Windows.
      # A process that can set the foreground window can enable another process to set the foreground window
      # by calling the AllowSetForegroundWindow function. The process specified by dwProcessId loses the
      # ability to set the foreground window the next time the user generates input, unless the input is
      # directed at that process, or the next time a process calls AllowSetForegroundWindow, unless that
      # process is specified.

      #                       If the specified window is a topmost window, the handle identifies the topmost window

      #                       If the specified window is a topmost window, the handle identifies the topmost window

      # hWnd:: [in] Handle to the window whose parent window handle is to be retrieved.
      #
      # *Returns*:: If the window is a child window, the return value is a handle to the parent window. If the
      #             window is a top-level window, the return value is a handle to the owner window. If the
      #             window is a top-level unowned window or if the function fails, the return value is NULL.
      #             To get extended error information, call GetLastError. For example, this would determine,
      #             when the function returns NULL, if the function failed or the window was a top-level window.
      # ---
      # *Remarks*:
      # Note that, despite its name, this function can return an owner window instead of a parent window. To
      # obtain the parent window and not the owner, use GetAncestor with the GA_PARENT flag.

      # hwnd:: [in] Handle to the window whose ancestor is to be retrieved. If this parameter is the desktop
      #        window, the function returns NULL.
      # gaFlags:: [in] Specifies the ancestor to be retrieved. This parameter can be one of the following values:
      #           GA_PARENT - Retrieves parent window. Unlike GetParent function, this does NOT include the owner.
      #           GA_ROOT - Retrieves the root window by walking the chain of parent windows.
      #           GA_ROOTOWNER - Retrieves the owned root window by walking the chain of parent and owner windows
      #                          returned by GetParent.
      #
      # *Returns*:: The return value is the handle to the ancestor window.

        show_window(win_handle, SW_HIDE)

      # Shuts down the window <b>created by different thread</b> by posting WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_CLOSE message to it.
      # This closely emulates user clicking on X button of the target window. As it would be expected, this
      # actually gives the target window chance to close gracefully (it may ask user to save data and stuff).
      # I have not found so far how to REALLY destroy window in different thread without it asking user anything.

      def shut_window( win_handle )

      # Returns text associated with window by sending WM_GETTEXT message to it.
