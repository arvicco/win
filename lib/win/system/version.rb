      # To retrieve information for the operating system on a remote computer, use the NetWkstaGetInfo
      # function, the Win32_OperatingSystem WMI class, or the OperatingSystem property of the IADsComputer
      # interface.
      #
      # To compare the current system version to a required version, use the VerifyVersionInfo function
      # instead of using GetVersionEx to perform the comparison yourself.
      # If compatibility mode is in effect, the GetVersionEx function reports the operating system as it
      # identifies itself, which may not be the operating system that is installed. For example, if
      # compatibility mode is in effect, GetVersionEx reports the operating system that is selected for
      # application compatibility.
      #
      # When using the GetVersionEx function to determine whether your application is running on a particular

      # The VerifyVersionInfo function retrieves version information about the currently running operating
      # system and compares it to the valid members of the lpVersionInfo structure. This enables you to easily
      # determine the presence of a required set of operating system version conditions. It is preferable to
      # use VerifyVersionInfo rather than calling the GetVersionEx function to perform your own comparisons.
      # Typically, VerifyVersionInfo returns a nonzero value only if all specified tests succeed. However,
      # major, minor, and service pack versions are tested in a hierarchical manner because the operating
      # system version is a combination of these values. If a condition exists for the major version, it
      # supersedes the conditions specified for minor version and service pack version. (You cannot test for
      # major version greater than 5 and minor version less than or equal to 1. If you specify such a test,
      # the function will change the request to test for a minor version greater than 1 because it is
      # performing a greater than operation on the major version.)
      #
      # The function tests these values in this order: major version, minor version, and service pack version.
      # The function continues testing values while they are equal, and stops when one of the values does not
      # meet the specified condition. For example, if you test for a system greater than or equal to version
      # 5.1 service pack 1, the test succeeds if the current version is 6.0. (The major version is greater
      # than the specified version, so the testing stops.) In the same way, if you test for a system greater
      # than or equal to version 5.1 service pack 1, the test succeeds if the current version is 5.2. (The
      # minor version is greater than the specified versions, so the testing stops.) However, if you test for
      # a system greater than or equal to version 5.1 service pack 1, the test fails if the current version is
      # 5.0 service pack 2. (The minor version is not greater than the specified version, so the testing stops.)
      #
      # To verify a range of system versions, you must call VerifyVersionInfo twice. For example, to verify
      # that the system version is greater than 5.0 but less than or equal to 5.1, first call
      # VerifyVersionInfo to test that the major version is 5 and the minor version is greater than 0, then
      # call VerifyVersionInfo again to test that the major version is 5 and the minor version is less than or
      # equal to 1.
      #
      # Identifying the current operating system is usually not the best way to determine whether a particular
      # operating system feature is present. This is because the operating system may have had new features
      # added in a redistributable DLL. Rather than using GetVersionEx to determine the operating system
      # platform or version number, test for the presence of the feature itself. For more information,
      # {see Operating System Version}[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724832%28v=VS.85%29.aspx].
      # To verify whether the current operating system is either the Media Center or Tablet PC version of
      # Windows, call GetSystemMetrics.

      # dwlConditionMask:: A value to be passed as the dwlConditionMask parameter of the VerifyVersionInfo function.
      #                    The function stores the comparison information in the bits of this variable.
      #                    Before the first call to VerSetCondition, initialize this variable to zero. For subsequent
      #                    calls, pass in the variable used in the previous call.
      # dwTypeBitMask:: A mask that indicates the member of the OSVERSIONINFOEX structure whose comparison operator is
      #                 being set. This value corresponds to one of the bits specified in the dwTypeMask parameter for
      #                 the VerifyVersionInfo function. This parameter can be one of the following values:
      #                 VER_BUILDNUMBER:: dwBuildNumber
      #                 VER_MAJORVERSION:: dwMajorVersion

      #                 VER_SUITENAME:: wSuiteMask
      # dwConditionMask:: The operator to be used for the comparison. The VerifyVersionInfo function uses this operator
      #                   to compare a specified attribute value to the corresponding value for the currently running
      #                   system. For all values of dwTypeBitMask other than VER_SUITENAME, this parameter can be one
      #                   of the following:
      #                   VER_EQUAL:: The current value must be equal to the specified value.
      #                   VER_GREATER:: The current value must be greater than the specified value.
      #                   VER_GREATER_EQUAL:: The current value must be greater than or equal to the specified value.
      #                   VER_LESS:: The current value must be less than the specified value.
      #                   VER_LESS_EQUAL:: The current value must be less than or equal to the specified value.
      #                   If dwTypeBitMask is VER_SUITENAME, this parameter can be one of the following values:
      #                   VER_AND:: All product suites specified in the wSuiteMask member must be present in the system.
      #                   VER_OR:: At least one of the specified product suites must be present in the current system.
      #
      # *Returns*:: The function returns the condition mask value.
