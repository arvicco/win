      # wParam:: [in] Specifies additional message-specific information.
      # lParam:: [in] Specifies additional message-specific information.
      #
      # *Returns*:: Typically, the dialog box procedure should return TRUE if it processed the message, and
      #             FALSE if it did not. If the dialog box procedure returns FALSE, the dialog manager
      #             performs the default dialog operation in response to the message.
      # If the dialog box procedure processes a message that requires a specific return value, the dialog box
      # procedure should set the desired return value by calling SetWindowLong(hwndDlg, DWL_MSGRESULT,
      # lResult) immediately before returning TRUE. Note that you must call SetWindowLong immediately before
      # returning TRUE; doing so earlier may result in the DWL_MSGRESULT value being overwritten by a nested
      # dialog box message.
      # The following messages are exceptions to the general rules stated above. Consult the documentation for
      # the specific message for details on the semantics of the return value.

      # lpText:: [in] Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the message to be displayed.
      # lpCaption:: [in] Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the dialog box title. If this
      #             parameter is NULL, the default title Error is used.
      # uType:: [in] Specifies the contents and behavior of the dialog box. This parameter can be a
      #         combination of flags from the following groups of flags.
      #         To indicate the buttons displayed in the message box, specify one of the following values.

      #         MB_DEFBUTTON1, MB_DEFBUTTON2, MB_DEFBUTTON3, MB_DEFBUTTON4
      #         To indicate the modality of the dialog box, specify one of the following values.
      #         MB_APPLMODAL, MB_SYSTEMMODAL, MB_TASKMODAL
      #         To specify other options, use one or more of the following values.

      # *Returns*:: If a message box has a Cancel button, the function returns the IDCANCEL value if either
      #             the ESC key is pressed or the Cancel button is selected. If the message box has no Cancel
      #             button, pressing ESC has no effect.

      # IDABORT:: Abort button was selected.
      # IDCANCEL:: Cancel button was selected.

      # *Remarks*:
      # Adding two right-to-left marks (RLMs), represented by Unicode formatting character U+200F, in the
      # beginning of a MessageBox display string is interpreted by the Win32 MessageBox rendering engine so as
      # to cause the reading order of the MessageBox to be rendered as right-to-left (RTL).
      # When you use a system-modal message box to indicate that the system is low on memory, the strings
      # pointed to by the lpText and lpCaption parameters should not be taken from a resource file because an
      # attempt to load the resource may fail.
      # If you create a message box while a dialog box is present, use a handle to the dialog box as the hWnd
      # parameter. The hWnd parameter should not identify a child window, such as a control in a dialog box.
      # Windows 95/98/Me: The system can support a maximum of 16,364 window handles.
      # Windows NT/2000/XP: The value of MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION changed starting with Windows NT 4.0. Windows
      # NT 4.0 provides backward compatibility for preexisting services by mapping the old value to the new
      # value in the implementation of MessageBox. This mapping is done only for executables that have a
      # version number earlier than 4.0, as set by the linker.
      # To build a service that uses MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION and can run on both Microsoft Windows NT 3.x and
      # Windows NT 4.0, you can do one of the following.
      # At link-time, specify a version number less than 4.0.
      # At link-time, specify version 4.0. At run-time, use the GetVersionEx function to check the system
      # version. Then, when running on Windows NT 3.x, use MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION_NT3X; and on Windows NT
      # 4.0, use MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION.
      # Windows 95/98/Me: Even though MessageBoxW exists, it is supported by the Microsoft Layer for Unicode
      # on Windows 95/98/Me Systems to give more consistent behavior across all Windows operating systems.
