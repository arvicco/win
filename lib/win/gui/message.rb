      # Windows XP: If a top-level window stops responding to messages for more than several seconds, the

      # wRemoveMsg:: <in> Specifies how messages are handled. This parameter can be one of the following values.
      #              - PM_NOREMOVE - Messages are not removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage.
      #              - PM_REMOVE - Messages are removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage.
      #              You can optionally combine the value PM_NOYIELD with either PM_NOREMOVE or PM_REMOVE. This flag
      #              prevents the system from releasing any thread that is waiting for the caller to go idle (see
      #              WaitForInputIdle). By default, all message types are processed. To specify that only certain
      #              message should be processed, specify one or more of the following values.
      #              - PM_QS_INPUT - Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process mouse and keyboard messages.
      #              - PM_QS_PAINT - Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process paint messages.
      #              - PM_QS_POSTMESSAGE - Win 98/Me/2000/XP: Process all posted messages, including timers and hotkeys.
      #              - PM_QS_SENDMESSAGE - Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process all sent messages.
      #
      # *Returns*:: If a message is available, returns nonzero. If no messages are available, the return value is zero.

      # *Remarks*:
      # PeekMessage retrieves messages associated with the window identified by the hWnd parameter or any of
      # its children as specified by the IsChild function, and within the range of message values given by the
      # wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax parameters. Note that an App can only use the low word in the
      # wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax parameters; the high word is reserved for the system.
      #
      # Note that PeekMessage always retrieves WM_QUIT messages, no matter which values you specify for
      # wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax.
      #
      # During this call, the system delivers pending, nonqueued messages, that is, messages sent to windows
      # owned by the calling thread using the SendMessage, SendMessageCallback, SendMessageTimeout, or
      # SendNotifyMessage function. Then the first queued message that matches the specified filter is
      # retrieved. The system may also process internal events. If no filter is specified, messages are
      # processed in the following order:
      # 1. Sent messages
      # 2. Posted messages
      # 3. Input (hardware) messages and system internal events
      # 4. Sent messages (again)
      # 5. WM_PAINT messages
      # 6. WM_TIMER messages
      #
      # To retrieve input messages before posted messages, use the wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax parameters.
      #
      # The PeekMessage function normally does not remove WM_PAINT messages from the queue. WM_PAINT messages
      # remain in the queue until they are processed. However, if a WM_PAINT message has a NULL update region,
      # PeekMessage does remove it from the queue.
      #
      # Windows XP: If a top-level window stops responding to messages for more than several seconds, the
      # system considers the window to be not responding and replaces it with a ghost window that has the same
      # z-order, location, size, and visual attributes. This allows the user to move it, resize it, or even
      # close the App. However, these are the only actions available because the App is
      # actually not responding. When an App is being debugged, the system does not generate a ghost
      # window.

      # The TranslateMessage function translates virtual-key messages into character messages. The character

      #
      # [*Syntax*]  BOOL TranslateMessage( const MSG *lpMsg );
      #
      # lpMsg:: <in> Pointer to an MSG structure that contains message information retrieved from the calling
      #         thread's message queue by using the GetMessage or PeekMessage function.
      #
      # *Returns*:: If the message is translated (that is, a character message is posted to the thread's
      #             message queue), the return value is nonzero.
      #             If the message is WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP, WM_SYSKEYDOWN, or WM_SYSKEYUP, the return value is
      #             nonzero, regardless of the translation.
      #             If the message is not translated (that is, a character message is not posted to the thread's
      #             message queue), the return value is zero.
      # ---
      # *Remarks*:
      # The TranslateMessage function does not modify the message pointed to by the lpMsg parameter.
      #
      # WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP combinations produce a WM_CHAR or WM_DEADCHAR message. WM_SYSKEYDOWN and
      # WM_SYSKEYUP combinations produce a WM_SYSCHAR or WM_SYSDEADCHAR message.
      #
      # TranslateMessage produces WM_CHAR messages only for keys that are mapped to ASCII characters by the
      # keyboard driver.
      #
      # If Apps process virtual-key messages for some other purpose, they should not call
      # TranslateMessage. For instance, an App should not call TranslateMessage if the
      # TranslateAccelerator function returns a nonzero value. Note that the App is responsible for
      # retrieving and dispatching input messages to the dialog box. Most Apps use the main message
      # loop for this. However, to permit the user to move to and to select controls by using the keyboard,
      # the App must call IsDialogMessage. For more information, see Dialog Box Keyboard Interface.
